/// The Watchdog class provides the interface to the Watchdog feature
///
/// Embedded programs, by their nature, are usually unattended. If things
/// go wrong, it is usually important that the system attempts to recover.
/// Aside from robust software, a hardware watchdog can monitor the
/// system and initiate a system reset when appropriate.
///
/// This Watchdog is patterned after one found elsewhere on the mbed site,
/// however this one also provides a method for the application software
/// to determine the cause of the reset - watchdog or otherwise.
///
/// Supports:
/// \li TARGET_LPC1768 
/// \li TARGET_LPC4088
/// \li TARGET_STM
///
/// example:
/// @code
/// Watchdog wd;
///
/// ...
/// main() {
///    if (wd.WatchdogCausedReset())
///        pc.printf("Watchdog caused reset.\r\n");
///      
///    wd.Configure(3.0);       // sets the timeout interval
///    for (;;) {
///         wd.Service();       // kick the dog before the timeout
///         // do other work
///    }
